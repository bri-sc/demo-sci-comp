# demo-sci-comp

This is a Bristol Scientific Computing (BriSC) Python interactive demonstration. This provides a taster for the type of coding and approach we take on the "X with [Scientific] Computing" and "Scientific Computing with Data Science" programmes at the University of Bristol. See the [BriSC webpages](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/science/undergraduate/brisc/) and [Postgraduate Programme for Scientific Computing with Data Science](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught/msc-scientific-computing-with-data-science/) for more details.
