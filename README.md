## Air quality demo

This is a Bristol Scientific Computing (BriSC) Python interactive demonstration. This provides a taster for the type of coding and approach we take on the "X with Computing" and "Scientific Computing with Data Science" programmes at the University of Bristol. See the [BriSC webpage](https://brisc.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/) and [Postgraduate Programme for Scientific Computing with Data Science](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught/msc-scientific-computing-with-data-science/) for more details.

This demo investigates air quality measurements taken around Bristol and looks at whether we can determine the impact 2020 and lockdown had on air quaity in the city.

Note: this may take a while to load as MyBinder is building a coding environment for you to use in the cloud. This will not save any changes made to the file and will timeout after a few minutes of inactivity but can be relaunched.

This demonstration makes use of data obtained from Open Data Bristol Air Quality Data Continuous dataset (available to view: https://opendata.bristol.gov.uk/apps/bcc::air-quality-dashboard/explore).
